## Before using <a name = "beforeusing"></a>
Well, at the moment this version of dbots' frontend is still in development, so you really can't access it now.

## Why? <a name = "why"></a>
Dbots' API is being rewrited and migrating all the queries/mutations on the old web would be hard as fuck, so I decided to make a brand new frontend, featuring much better practices, better file organization, etc.

## Quick reminder <a name = "reminder"></a>
While the new API is being made, this version of the frontend uses mock data on every place and It has 0 real data.
